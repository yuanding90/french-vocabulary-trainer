## Pending Changes (To-Do List)

### ðŸ”„ Step 6: Study Session SRS Logic - COMPREHENSIVE FIXES
**Status:** Analysis Complete - Ready to implement
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for proper spaced repetition

#### **Database Schema Updates:**
- [ ] **Add `repetitions` column to `user_progress` table**
  - Field: `repetitions INTEGER DEFAULT 0`
  - Purpose: Track how many times a word has been successfully reviewed
  - Required for proper SRS interval calculations

- [ ] **Create `rating_history` table**
  - Fields: `id`, `word_id`, `rating`, `timestamp`
  - Purpose: Track consecutive ratings for leech removal logic
  - Required for sophisticated leech management

#### **SRS Algorithm Fixes:**
- [ ] **Fix interval calculation for new words**
  - Current: Always uses `Math.floor(currentInterval * easeFactor)`
  - Required: 
    - `repetitions === 0`: `interval = 1`
    - `repetitions === 1`: `interval = 6`
    - `repetitions > 1`: `interval = Math.ceil(interval * ease_factor)`

- [ ] **Fix ease factor calculation**
  - Current: Simple increments/decrements
  - Required: Complex formula: `ease_factor + (0.1 - (5 - ratingValue) * (0.08 + (5 - ratingValue) * 0.02))`
  - Rating values: hard=3, good=4, easy=5

- [ ] **Fix hard rating logic**
  - Current: `Math.floor(currentInterval * 0.6)`
  - Required: `Math.max(1, Math.ceil(interval / 2))`

- [ ] **Add repetitions tracking to SRS logic**
  - Increment repetitions on 'good' or 'easy' ratings
  - Reset repetitions to 0 on 'again' rating
  - Use repetitions for interval calculations

#### **Leech Management Enhancements:**
- [ ] **Implement leech removal logic**
  - Remove from leeches after 2 consecutive 'easy' ratings
  - Only if interval >= 7 days
  - Reset `again_count` to 0

- [ ] **Add rating history tracking**
  - Log every rating with timestamp
  - Track last 10 ratings for leech removal decisions
  - Store in `rating_history` table

- [ ] **Implement leech spacing in queue building**
  - Separate leeches from regular words
  - Insert leeches every 3-5 regular words
  - Prevent leech fatigue

#### **Queue System Improvements:**
- [ ] **Enhance near future queue logic**
  - Current: Uses `isNearFuture()` function
  - Required: Check if due within next 24 hours
  - Add visual indicators for near future words

- [ ] **Fix queue numbers display**
  - Debug why metrics show 0
  - Ensure proper queue calculation
  - Add queue debug panel

#### **Code Structure Updates:**
- [ ] **Update `saveWordProgress` function**
  - Add repetitions logic
  - Implement proper SRS algorithm
  - Add rating history logging

- [ ] **Update `SessionQueueManager`**
  - Add leech spacing logic
  - Enhance queue building
  - Fix metrics calculation

- [ ] **Add leech removal functions**
  - `removeFromLeech()` function
  - Rating history analysis
  - Automatic leech removal

#### **Testing & Validation:**
- [ ] **Test SRS algorithm accuracy**
  - Compare intervals with HTML app
  - Verify ease factor calculations
  - Test leech removal logic

- [ ] **Test queue building**
  - Verify leech spacing
  - Test near future queue
  - Validate metrics calculation

- [ ] **Performance optimization**
  - Optimize database queries
  - Reduce unnecessary recalculations
  - Add caching where appropriate

### ðŸ”„ Step 7: Additional UI Polish
**Status:** Ready to implement
**Changes needed:**
- Add loading states for better UX
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
- Optimize performance for large decks

### ðŸ”„ Step 8: Advanced Features
**Status:** Future implementation
**Changes needed:**
- Export progress data functionality
- Statistics and analytics dashboard
- Custom deck creation
- Social features (leaderboards, sharing)

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
- `vocabulary_decks`: Deck information
- `vocabulary`: Individual vocabulary words
- `deck_vocabulary`: Relationship between decks and words
- `user_progress`: Individual word progress for users
- `user_deck_progress`: Overall deck progress for users
- `study_sessions`: Session tracking

### Key Features Implemented
- Spaced Repetition System (SRS)
- Multiple study modes (Review, Discovery, Deep Dive)
- Progress tracking and visualization
- OAuth authentication
- Responsive design

### Known Issues
- Dashboard metrics sometimes show 0 (needs investigation)
- Queue numbers not updating correctly
- Some visual layout issues in study sessions

### SRS Logic Analysis (Current Session)
**Date:** Current Session
**Analysis:** Compared our SRS implementation with the HTML app's proven algorithm

#### **Critical Differences Found:**
1. **Missing Repetitions Tracking**: Our app doesn't track `repetitions` field, which is essential for proper interval calculations
2. **Incorrect SRS Algorithm**: Our ease factor and interval calculations don't match the proven HTML app algorithm
3. **Missing Leech Removal**: No sophisticated leech removal logic with rating history tracking
4. **Basic Queue Building**: No leech spacing or advanced queue management
5. **Incomplete Near Future Logic**: Near future queue logic needs enhancement

#### **HTML App SRS Algorithm (Reference):**
```javascript
// Proper interval calculation
if (repetitions === 0) interval = 1;
else if (repetitions === 1) interval = 6;
else interval = Math.ceil(interval * ease_factor);

// Proper ease factor calculation
const ratingValue = { hard: 3, good: 4, easy: 5 }[rating];
ease_factor = Math.max(MIN_EASE_FACTOR, ease_factor + (0.1 - (5 - ratingValue) * (0.08 + (5 - ratingValue) * 0.02)));

// Leech removal logic
if (wasLeech && rating === 'easy' && interval >= 7) {
  const recentRatings = getRecentRatings(wordId);
  if (recentRatings.length >= 2 && recentRatings.slice(-2).every(r => r === 'easy')) {
    again_count = 0; // Remove from leeches
  }
}
```

#### **Impact:**
- Users may experience suboptimal spaced repetition intervals
- Leech words may not be properly managed
- Queue building may not provide optimal learning experience
- Metrics may be inaccurate due to incorrect calculations
